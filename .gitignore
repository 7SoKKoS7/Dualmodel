# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# Pipenv
#   Ignore the virtual environment directories created by Pipenv. Using Pipenv can make
#   managing virtual environments easier, but including the virtual environment
#   directory in the project can lead to conflicts and unnecessary bloat.

# Poetry
#   Similar to Pipenv, Poetry manages dependencies and virtual environments. Its lock
#   file should be checked in, but the virtual environment directory should be ignored.
